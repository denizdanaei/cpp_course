# StudentManager
Covers: structs, classes, dynamic memory, pointers, constructors, const correctness

## Goal:

Design a program to manage student records:

- Each Student has a name, roll number, and GPA.
- Dynamically store n students using a StudentManager class.
- Provide:
    - `addStudent()`
    - `printAll()`
    - `getTopper()` (returns the one with highest GPA)

**Bonus:** Ensure `printAll()` is const, and StudentManager handles cleanup with destructor.
