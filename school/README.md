# School Management System
Covers: classes, inheritance, polymorphism, file I/O

## Goal:

Build a school management system using advanced object-oriented concepts:

- Create base Person class with common attributes
- Implement Student and Teacher derived classes
- Use inheritance and polymorphism
- Add file operations for data persistence:
    - `Person(string name, int age, string id)`
    - `Student::addGrade(double grade)`
    - `Teacher::assignCourse(string course)`
    - `School::enrollStudent(const Student& student)`
    - `School::saveToFile(const string& filename)`

**Bonus:** Add course enrollment system and grade report generation.
