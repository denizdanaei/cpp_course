# Student Class
Covers: classes, objects, encapsulation, member functions

## Goal:

Create a basic Student class to practice object-oriented programming fundamentals:

- Design a Student class with private attributes
- Implement public member functions
- Practice encapsulation and data validation
- Essential class components:
    - `Student(string name, int age, string studentId)`
    - `void addGrade(double grade)`
    - `double getAverageGrade() const`
    - `void displayInfo() const`
    - Getter and setter methods for private attributes

**Bonus:** Add grade validation (0-100 range) and honor roll status checking.
