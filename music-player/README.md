# Music Player
Covers: classes, objects, encapsulation, methods

## Goal:

Create a simple music player using object-oriented programming:

- Design a Song class with attributes (title, artist, duration)
- Design a Playlist class to manage songs
- Implement basic player functionality:
    - `Song(string title, string artist, int duration)`
    - `Playlist::addSong(const Song& song)`
    - `Playlist::removeSong(const string& title)`
    - `Playlist::displayPlaylist()`
    - `Playlist::shuffle()`

**Bonus:** Add play history tracking and favorite songs functionality.
